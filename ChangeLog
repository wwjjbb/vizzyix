Changelog for vizzyix - a portage package browser

vizzyix-0.6.0
  - tidy up category names with more than one dash (the ones
    created by crossdev)
  - File|Load should work now, and the messages to say that
    eix-update needs to be run now appear at the right time.
  - in source code, applied a consistent naming schem for
    private attributes, and also tried to get function defs
    in same order as the header declarations and with public
    names at start of the class.
  - eix database popups now appear in centre of main window
    rather than at random locations on desktop.
  - spdx replace .license files with entries in toml file

vizzyix-0.5.1
