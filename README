Vizzyix - a GUI portage package browser

This is a package browser which uses eix to search the package database, and a Qt GUI to show the results. That's it really; it doesn't need permissions for building packages because it doesn't do building, which means it can run with normal user permissions.

DEPENDENCIES

Dynamically linked to:
    * Qt6 (Core, Gui, Svg, SvgWidgets)
    * Protobuf

Requires >=app-portage/eix-0.34.11 to be built with protobuf support, and for the "eix.proto" file from the eix source archive to be installed at /usr/share/eix.

SOURCE

Written in C++ (C++17).

The project is configured to use clang-format to manage format of the code. This is controlled by the top level file, ".clang-format".

BUILD

    * Using meson (preferrred)
         Create a new directory and cd into it
         Unpack the source archive and cd into it's top directory
         $ meson ../meson-build
         $ cd ../meson-build
         $ meson compile

TESTS

There are some basic tests - these may be run from the Tools | Test menu in QtCreator, or in meson by running this in the meson build directory:

  $ meson test

PORTAGE

The eix and vizzyix ebuilds are in the scripts/ directory. These are intended to go in your overlay - rename to add the required version numbers: the eix version should be the same as the current gentoo version number, and the vizzyix version should be one of the versions in github.
